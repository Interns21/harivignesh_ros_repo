## Autonomous Wheeled Mobile Robot
A display of my work during the internship where I implemented my learnings in simulating a differential drive robot. A differential drive robot was built in gazebo from scratch and is shown below. Cartographer was used to map the environment. Navigation stack was used to navigate the robot. All the work was done in ROS-Noetic.
To launch the robot and navigate it by giving position goals in rviz, run the diff_drive_robot.launch file.
```
roslaunch diff_drive_robot_sim diff_drive_robot.launch
```
