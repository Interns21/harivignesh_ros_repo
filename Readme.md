## Autonomous Wheeled Mobile Robot
My work thus far in the internship where I implemented my learnings in simulating a differential drive robot. Cartographer was used to map the environment. Navigation stack was used to navigate the robot. All the work was done in ROS-Noetic.
To launch the robot and navigate it by giving position goals in rviz, run the diff_drive_robot.launch file.
```
roslaunch diff_drive_robot_sim diff_drive_robot.launch
```
